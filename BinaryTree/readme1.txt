Description:
This is a java program that creates a binary tree out of a string of user input letters. Each letter will be displayed in its own node. The program also display various traversals(PreOrder, PostOrder, InOrder) of the tree.

Instructions:
When the program starts, the user will be prompted to type s to display the tree, i to insert a letter into the tree, t to pick which tree traversal to display, or e to exit the program. If the user enters an invalid value, they will be prompted to try again.

If the user inputs i, they will be prompted to input a letter. If the user inputs multiple strings, only the first letter of the first string will be added to the tree.

if the user inputs t, they will be given the choice to input 1, 2, or 3. If the user inputs 1, a preorder traversal will be displayed. If the user inputs 2, an inorder traversal will be displayed. if the user inputs 3, a postorder traversal will be displayed.
